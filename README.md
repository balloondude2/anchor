## What is this?

Anchor is a mod+server that enables co-op on Ship of Harkinian. It's primary functions are loading save state from a remote player when you join their session, and sending flag sets/item gives across all players in a session. This is not multi-world, and it requires that all players have the same randomizer seed loaded, but this is a great example to reference for it and other multiplayer ventures.

## How to

You don't need this, I'm hosting this on my end. Instead see [the associated SoH Build](https://github.com/garrettjoecox/OOT/pull/52)
